            let's say your are learning to skate, so you will follow a lot of skaters but consequently you will find your feed flooded with just skating content, making you miss out on latest posts from family and friends. How are we fixing this?
            <br/> <br/>
            Whenever you follows someone, we ask you to categorize them as family, friend or hobby. So that we can show separate feed for each category.
            <br/> <br/>
            One more thing, When you open the app we show the 4 most recent content from each feed, so that you can update yourself with minimal scroll.

      We often create multiple instragram account to separate friends and family.
      <br/> <br/>
      To solve this we created folders. It is a way to categorize your followers
      <br/> <br/>
      By default you get 4 different folders in your profile. Family, Friends, Work & passion.
      <br/> <br/>
      For example: When you will post something in friends folder, your family won’t see it..
      <br/> <br/>
      Family and Friends are private by default while work and passion are public

      We allow various customizations, like  templates, components, creating pages, list and folders.

      This allows you to express yourself more precisely

      Sometimes it is hard to convey the reality because we don’t want to look weak or hurt the people who chearing for us but this can make us lonely
      <br/> <br/>
      That is why there is an additional folder called Incognito in your profile, if you post in this folder it will be posted to the incognito feed where no can identify you. Your name will be replaced by a pen name and other details will be made hidden
