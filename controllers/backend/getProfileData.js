/*

  Why  store followingCount count in doc?
  * we will need to add additional index for senderID field
  * keeping track of followingCount is easy

  why not store likesReceived count in doc?
  * we have index for receiverID
  * storing this value will be complicated

  why not store articleCount count in doc?
  * we have index for authorID  
  * storing this value will be complicated

  
  Why are we storing count value in document iteself but not always?
  * count is almost like making a full fletched find query with no limit
  * count is expensive
  * storng count in doc makes read faster at the expense of write operation
  * which is fair as reads happen more often than writes
  * this also circumvents the need for additional indexes
  * but sometimes it is too complicated to keep track of count like in
    * likes count
    * article count
    * draft count
  * so in complicated cases it is not ideal to store count value
